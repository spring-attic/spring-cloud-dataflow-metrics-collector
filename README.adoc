== Spring cloud dataflow metrics collector
_"There's no knowledge that is not power" - Ralph Waldo Emerson_

The metrics collector is a companion application to the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/[Spring Cloud Dataflow] server.

It collects metrics emitted by http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/[Spring Cloud Stream] apps, and groups them together around the stream definition that dataflow used to deploy them.

All of the OOB http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/[Spring Cloud App Starters] currently have the metrics emitter module already bundled on it.
You can enable metric emission by setting the destination name for metrics binding, e.g. `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=<DESTINATION_NAME>`

Starting with Spring Cloud Stream 2.0 the metrics has been switched to use https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer]. See https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/Elmhurst.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-stream-overview-metrics-emitter [Metrics Emitter] for more details
Information how to configure the metrics for legacy Spring Cloud Stream 1.x applications is provided https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/Ditmars.SR3/reference/htmlsingle/#_metrics_emitter[here].

The metrics collector 2.x can collect and process metrics coming from Spring Cloud Stream 1.x and 2.x applications.

== Building

Because apps could use different binder implementations (RabbitMQ, Kafka, JMS), the collector is built using the same support provided by the App Starters to
create an executable uber jar artifact per binder.

To build you need first generate the source code for the apps of each binder:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean install -PgenerateApps
----

This will generate an `apps` folder like the one below:

```
apps
├── metrics-collector-kafka
├── metrics-collector-rabbit
└── pom.xml
```

So, let's assume your environment have apps deployed using RabbitMQ, cd into the `metrics-collector-rabbit` folder and run

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package
----

You should find the *uber jar* of the collector inside your `target` folder.

== Running

The collector is an *uber jar* following the same principles of any Spring Cloud Stream app.
So it means, that you need to provide connection information to the broker that you are using.
Just follow the instructions on https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/Elmhurst.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/index.html[Spring Cloud Stream] docs on how to configure each binder.
If you are deploying on a platform such as cloudfoundry, you only need to bind a rabbitmq service to the collector.

=== Configuring

The default destination that the collector listens to is named `metrics`.  You
can override this default by setting the property
`spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=<DESTINATION_NAME>`
This should match the destination that Spring Cloud Stream applications
use to send metrics, which is set using the property
`spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=<DESTINATION_NAME>`

Assuming apps have been deployed configuring `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=metrics`.  For the RabbitMQ binder, the collector will create an anonymous consumer to an exchange called `metrics`.  For the Kafka binder, the collector creates a Kafka topic named `metrics`.

=== Controlling eviction

Internally the collector maintains a cache of the metrics it receives. The default for metric emission is every 60 seconds (for Spring Boot 1.x applications it is every 5 seconds), but can be tuned on the application by using Spring Boot's metrics exporter scheduling control, please refer to the docs https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/Elmhurst.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/index.html#spring-cloud-stream-overview-metrics-emitter[here] to configure your applications.

The default for the collector is to evict any metric reading that was not updated over the past 90 seconds.
You can however change this value by setting the property `spring.cloud.dataflow.metrics.collector.evictionTimeout`

== Security

The collector will have security enabled by default, make sure you start it with a proper username/password using `--spring.security.user.name` and `--spring.security.user.password`

== E2E Cheat sheet

The following is just a sample of commands that one can use to get the collector up and running and see some metrics on the dataflow UI.

```
Collector:
java -jar target/metrics-collector-rabbit-2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.security.user.name=spring --spring.security.user.password=cloud

Server:
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/target/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-1.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.cloud.dataflow.metrics.collector.uri=http://localhost:8080 --spring.cloud.dataflow.metrics.collector.username=spring --spring.cloud.dataflow.metrics.collector.password=cloud

Register SCSt 1.x Apps:
app import --uri http://bit.ly/Celsius-SR1-stream-applications-rabbit-maven

Or Register SCSt 2.x Apps: TODO

Stream:
stream create --name foostream --definition "time | log"
stream deploy --name foostream --properties "deployer.*.count=2,app.*.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=metrics"
```
